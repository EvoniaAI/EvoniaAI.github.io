# Repository Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript/JavaScript code style already used in the project.
- Prefer descriptive commit messages and PR titles summarizing the change.
- Ensure new workflows or configuration files are documented with comments when necessary.
- Run `npm run build` before submitting PRs touching build or deployment configuration when feasible.
